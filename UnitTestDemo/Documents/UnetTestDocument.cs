         * + Fake: A fake is a generic term that can be used to describe either a stub or a mock object.
         * + Mock: A mock is a fake object in the system that decides whether or not a unit test has passed or failed.
         * + Stub: A stub is a fake object in the system that decides whether or not a unit test has passed or failed.

         * Arrange, Act, Assert is a common pattern when unit testing. As the name implies, it consists of three main actions:
         *  Arrange your objects, create and set them up as necessary.
         *  Act on an object.
         *  Assert that something is as expected.
